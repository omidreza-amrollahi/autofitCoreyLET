## Relative permeability autofit 


#### Guideline: 
The input data file needs to be an excel file with the well IDs in a column named 'ID PK', the water saturation in a column named 'Sw', the relative permeability in a column named 'Krw', and gas relative permeability in a column named 'Krg'.
#### Units: 
Water saturation are input in percentage, and relative permeabilities are given in fraction.
